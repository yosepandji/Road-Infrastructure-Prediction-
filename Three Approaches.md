# Road-Infrastructure-Prediction-
There are three different approaches to the problem that I have.
1. K-fold Infrastructure Tender Classifier NN.
The first one is I tried to cluster the project durations into three different categories: Short Term, Medium Term, and Long Term. 
2. K-fold Infrastructure Tender Classifier NN-Databse 2.
The second approach is I clustered the project durations into two categories: Above Average and Below Average
3. K-fold Infrastructure Tender Classifier NN Database 3.
The third approach is I tried to form a NN model to deal with Regression Problem.
